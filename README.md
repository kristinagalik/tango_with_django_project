# tango_with_django_project

If you were confused how I managed to do the project in 4 hours, i did not plagiarise. Unfortunately, while working on the project (see my commits https://github.com/kristinagalik/tango_with_django_project1, there is my original finished project that took me 2.5 weeks) i forgot to make commits at the end of 2 or 3 chapters, so I decided to start over and finish it in one run. And copy-pasted a lot from my previous code, so if it seems i couldnt possibly finish any of those chapters in such a short time, its becuase i copied it from myself, my own code/or the TWD book. I did not use anybody elses code. So in case of any concern, here is my project once more for reference:

Thank you for understanding, and sorry if it raised any concern.
